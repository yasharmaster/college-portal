Welcome to the College Portal!

This is a web app created on Rails by Yash Sharma for Backbone competition in Aparoksha 2016.

In this application, registered users can-

1. Create Lost, found or other posts.
2. Comment on others post.

Unregistered users can only view the posts but cannot participate in the discussion.

Each user has a profile page having his gravatar profile image and list of all the posts by that user.

All the views are paginated, so each page won't display more than 5 posts.

Thank you.
